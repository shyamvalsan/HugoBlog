I'm Shyam Sreevalsan and this is my personal website. 

I am a computer science graduate who has worked as a software engineer and a variety of other roles in the software industry. I specialize in building intelligent networks and for some time now, I've been working on applying machine learning to computer networks and other problems I'm trying to solve.

When I'm not at work, I travel, I read, I write, I paint and I experiment with data.
