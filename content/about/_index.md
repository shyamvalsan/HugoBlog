I'm Shyam Valsan and I am a software engineer working with computer networks and telecommunications. I live in Bangalore, India with my wife and daughter. 

I studied computer science and graduated in 2007 from [MES College of Engineering] (http://www.mesce.ac.in/)([Calicut University](http://www.universityofcalicut.info/)) and did my masters degree in Software Systems from [BITS Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/). I currently work at [Sandvine Technologies](https://www.sandvine.com/) as Manager of Software Engineering. 

I love to travel, to read and to experiment with data. My C and C++ might have got a bit rusty but R is opening up new worlds for me, and the joy of unlocking secrets from data is unique.
