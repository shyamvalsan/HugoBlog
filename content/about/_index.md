I'm Shyam Sreevalsan and this is my personal website. 

I am a technology consultant who has worked in a variety of different roles in the software industry. I specialize in building intelligent networks and applying machine learning to solve hard problems in computer networks and telecommunications.

When I'm not at work, I travel, I read, I write, I paint and I experiment with data. 

My art is influenced by nature and culture heritage from around the world. I specialize in generative abstracts, data paintings and experiments in human-machine collaboration where the workflow involves alternating layers of human and computer generated artistic expression.
