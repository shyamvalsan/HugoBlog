I am one of those blighted with the "wandering gene", and don't ever really feel at home unless I just got back from an adventure or know there's another one on the horizon. I think it's hard to stop your mind from expanding and understanding the lived experiences of others when you travel the world - whether that's on foot, on wheels, by boat, by air, by book, by conversation or maybe just by meditation. 

Some of my writings on travel - admittedly not updated very often - can be found here: https://travelverse.blogspot.com/
