      <description>Yeelight (now owned by Xiaomi) is a company which makes smart bulbs which can be controlled over WiFi or BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). I got my hands on one of their WiFi smart bulbs as part of some hackathon goodies from work. They have a snappy android app which let&amp;rsquo;s you change colors, brightness and allow the light to flash/flow according to the music you&amp;rsquo;re playing. All very nice and dandy - but in the spirit of tinkerers and DIYers everywhere, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I was here for.</description>
